### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/singminhong/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree/blob/master/6_Time-Series-Forecasting/6.1_Forecast-Video-Game-Demand.pdf)

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.

Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
